Medical Insurance Price Prediction
The Medical Insurance Price Prediction project is a machine learning model designed to estimate insurance costs based on key personal and lifestyle factors.
This project uses a dataset containing information on BMI (Body Mass Index), smoking status, and the number of children, among other features. 
By analyzing these variables, the model predicts insurance premiums, helping individuals and insurers make data-driven decisions.

The model leverages supervised learning techniques to uncover relationships between the input variables and insurance costs. 
For instance, it highlights how a high BMI or smoking status significantly impacts premiums due to associated health risks. 
The inclusion of the number of children provides insights into how family size influences insurance pricing.

To use the project, clone this repository and load the dataset in the required format. The provided scripts guide users through data preprocessing, training, and evaluation of the model. 
The modelâ€™s predictions can be visualized through graphs or exported for integration with other tools.

This project is a valuable resource for anyone looking to understand or predict medical insurance pricing trends.
Contributions are welcome to enhance the model's accuracy and applicability.
